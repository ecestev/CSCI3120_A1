Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends an HTTP request for a valid file using a valid method but an invalid protocol. 

Expected Result: The web server should catch that the HTTP request is malformed and send the 
status line "HTTP/1.1 Bad Request" to the client.
