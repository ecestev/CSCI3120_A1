Title: Sendfile() Over Limit

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a properly formed HTTP request for a file whose exceeds the capabilities of the 
sendfile() function. 

Expected Result: The web server should catch that the file size is too large and send an 
error message. The sendfile() function can not send files whose size exceeds 
0x7ffff000 or 2,147,479,552 bytes and should not try or it may hang up.
